week2:
The project runs successfully on terminal.
The pollution model file is not uploaded due to GitHub size limits

Note: i have completed all weekly assignments on time and uplodaded it through lms but i had run streamlit in google cloud due to this i have to upload all files including pollution.pkl file so i have uploaded all files again in my github(but its showing like i have completed my assignments recently).
