week2:
The project runs successfully on terminal.
The pollution model file is not uploaded due to GitHub size limits

Note: I have completed all weekly assignments on time and uploaded them through the LMS. However, I deployed the Streamlit app using Google Cloud, which required me to upload all related files in one place (GitHub), including the `pollution.pkl` file. 

Due to this, I re-uploaded all project files to GitHub recently. Please note that this does not mean the project was done late â€” only the GitHub update was done later.
